1- Basics concepts

a- What is a DevOps? Its an integration of culture and practices that increases a companies abilities to deliver services at a higher velocity. This culture emphasizes more on collaboration and communication between the software developers and the IT professionals to bring about changes in improving products at faster and more efficient pace that companies traditional software development and infrastructure management processes . 

b- What is GIT? Its free and open source distributed version control system that is designed to handle everything from small to large projects with speed and efficiency in software development 

c- what is the difference between git ans svn?
1. Git is distributed version control system and SVN is a centralized control system. This means that with GIT every developer has his/her own respository of the old version of software developed whereas with SVN the version history is rather stored in server-side repository where the repository is located. 

d- what is continious integration? It is a practice which allows all the developers to put their code into a shared repository several times in a day. It is then verified by an automated system which allows the team to detect problems as soon as possible at its early stage. 

e- what is continious delevery? It is a software engineering approach in which teams produce a software in short period of time and ensure that the software can be reliably released at any time.

f- what is scrum? Scrum was formalized for software development projects as simpe agile framework for completing complex projects. But now, its possibilities are endless and works well for any complex and innovative scope of work. 
 
g- What is agile methodology? Agile methology is a process that promotes a disciplined project management process and encourages frequent inspection and adaptation.As a modern leadership philosophy; it encourages teamwork, self-organization and accountability as a set of engineering best practices intended for rapid delivery of high-quality software.In addition, its a business approach that aligns to the development of customer needs and the company goals.

h- what is release calender ? release calendar basically involves the scheduling of release days in given calendar of testing a products before they are released to production 

i- what is release date? The date that changes made in the lowest regions goes to productions

2- give 4 reasons why companies should consider the DevOps method
-  DevOps yields greater stability and reliability because the faster development and more frequent release schedule enables organizations to identify and resolve issues immediately.
-  DevOps the result when it comes to developing software is faster, more frequent delivery.
-  Organizations that have embraced DevOps also generally have tools in place to automate routine tasks which enables individuals to dedicate more time to growing the business and maintaining the status quo 
--the concept of DevOps results in lower maintenance and total life cycle costs due to greater productivity and efficient defect removal.

3- what are some automation tools used in the DevOps environment?
TestingWhiz, Selenium, HPE Unified Functional Testing (HP â€“ UFT formerly QTP), TestComplete, Ranorex, Sahi, Watir, Tosca Testsuite, Telerik TestStudio, WatiN.

4- why is it important to build the software in the test regions before delevering it to production?
- It is important to verify the product in a testing environment because you want to make sure that it works as expected. As such, most often this test environment is standardized and in close alignment with the target.
---To fix any defects before it is developed to production .
---The test environment is also a place for any try and error before it is sent to production and then to consumers. When for instance consumers get the bad or defect products it result in a lot of repercussion to the companies not mention but a few---reputational damages and losing valid customers.

5- create a project in your github repository called project4 and in project 4 , create a file called project11
6- copy your homework11 answers into the file project11 and commit it.
7- What is the url to access your github project11 file?
